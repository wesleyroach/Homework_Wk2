            One of the funniest ones I have heard is: Mary had a canary, she
            also had a duck She took it behined the kitchen door and taught it
            how to? Fried eggs and bacon, have a glass of wine, the more you
            eat, the more you drink, the more you want to Peter had a row boat
            and the boat began to rock, Up jumped JAWS and bit him on the
            Cocktail frankfurts, have a glass of wine If you don't like wine you
            can shove it up your Ask no questions tell no lies, I saw a
            policeman doing up his Flies are bad, mosquistoes are worse And that
            is the end of this silly little verse.

            I remember when I was young going to the footy with my mates When
            Carlton played at the 'G' we stop at the Duke of Wellington pub
            before and after the game. Anyway, late one night after the game I
            walked up to the bar, There was a younger guy (no more than 19)
            ordering in front of me. He asked for a rum and coke and a raspberry
            and vodka. He was being served by the owner. The barman (owner)
            said, "This isn't a ###g chemist shop you ####!" Hilarious
